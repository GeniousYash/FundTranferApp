To build the app where company owners can log in, enter their bank details, and perform NEFT/RTGS payments to other bank accounts, here's a detailed approach:

1. Bank API Integration:
    Bank-agnostic payments: Since each company might use a different bank, you need a platform that can work with multiple banks. This can be done via payment gateways or aggregators like:
    RazorpayX, ICICI API Banking, Yes Bank APIs, HDFC Bank, or Cashfree.


2. Steps to Build:
a. Authentication and Security
    Each company owner must log into your web app securely.
    OAuth or JWT tokens should be used to authenticate users.
    SSL/TLS encryption is mandatory for banking details.
b. Add/Link Bank Account:
    Each company owner will need to add their bank details (account number, IFSC, etc.) from which payments will be deducted.
    For multi-bank integration, payment gateways like RazorpayX or Cashfree offer APIs where you can handle different banks seamlessly.
    Tokenization of sensitive details like bank accounts ensures data is protected and compliant with regulatory norms.
c. Initiate NEFT/RTGS Payment:
    Allow the user to input the recipient's account details (Account number, IFSC) and amount.
    Send these details to the bank using bank-specific APIs or through payment gateways.
    Based on the input, select NEFT (for smaller amounts) or RTGS (for larger, immediate transfers).
d. Transaction Status and Logging:
    Once the transaction is initiated, track the transaction status (success/failure) via callbacks provided by the payment gateway or bank API.
    Record transaction details in the database for reconciliation, user tracking, and reporting.
e. KYC and Compliance:
    Ensure proper Know Your Customer (KYC) is done for companies using the service, and implement AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks.
    Work with your banking partners to adhere to RBI guidelines.


3. How the Architecture Could Look:
Frontend:
A simple form for logging in, linking a bank account, and entering transaction details (e.g., IFSC, account number).
Use React, Angular, or Vue for the front-end.

Backend:
Handle all API requests and responses from the banking system.
Use Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot to create the backend.
Connect with bank or payment gateway APIs using secure HTTP calls.

Database:
Store user details, linked bank accounts, and transaction history.
Use MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for persistence.

4. Testing & Deployment:
Use the sandbox environments of payment gateways for testing.
Implement unit tests, security audits, and UAT (User Acceptance Testing).
Deploy your app on a reliable cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure with strong security and scaling features.

5. Banking Integrations/Services:
You can choose any of the following API services for integration:
ICICI Bank API: Offers RTGS/NEFT functionality via their API.
RazorpayX: Provides bank-agnostic services for account transfers via NEFT/RTGS.
Yes Bank: Corporate banking APIs with multi-bank support.
Cashfree: Offers NEFT/RTGS payouts with a straightforward integration.
